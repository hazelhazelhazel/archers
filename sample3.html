			      		Early this month, Marcos went to the city-state and met with Singaporean Minister for Manpower Tan See Ling on the sidelines of the race. During the Senate committee on finance’s hearing on the 2023 budgets of the Office of the President and the Presidential Management Staff, Senate Minority Leader Aquilino Pimentel III asked if the said trip was personal or official.

			      		Bersamin replied: “No, it was mixed. You may put it that way because the President was actually invited by the Prime Minister of Singapore to join him in the revival of that F1 racing in Singapore.

			      		“The President most likely saw an opportunity for him to expand on the goodwill that he generated when he made the official state visit… The visit there is partly official, partly personal.”

			      		Earlier, Bersamin was quizzed about who funded the president’s trip, to which he responded, “irrelevant.”

			      		The executive secretary explained that he answered that way as it was difficult to distinguish which part of the trip was official and which part was personal.

			      		“I cannot know, it’s impossible to say which part of it is personal [and] which part is official. But actually, hindi po personal ‘yun eh. Dapat po malinaw sa atin ‘yun,” Bersamin said during the hearing.

			      		(But actually, that is not just personal. That should be clear.)

			      		But for Pimentel, the trip was official as it stemmed from an invitation from Singapore’s prime minister.
